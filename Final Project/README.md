# üìù Project Description: Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data to predict academic success using various machine learning models. The dataset includes comprehensive student-level information such as demographic details, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic metrics.

The goal of this project is to classify students into academic performance categories (A to F grade classes) based on their GPA and other influencing factors. The project pipeline involves:

* Loading and cleaning data from a CSV file
* Exploring and visualizing the dataset (distribution, types, and summary statistics)
* Understanding feature relationships (e.g., study time, parental support, extracurriculars) with academic outcomes
* Preparing data for modeling (including encoding, scaling, and splitting)
* Applying classification models such as:
  * Decision Trees
  * Random Forests
  * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  * Logistic Regression
  * Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports
  
This hands-on implementation provides insights into how multiple factors affect student success and demonstrates the application of machine learning models for educational analytics.
